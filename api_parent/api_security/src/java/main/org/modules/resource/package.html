			This is the module that provides classes and interfaces for accessing and processing data 
			pertaining to the application resources, their types, and sub types.  In the context of the 
			security API, a resource basically exists as a component or service that is made available 
			to any API.  At runtime, resources are generally housed in an in memory collection call the 
			<i>Resource Registry</i>.  This registry is the data source for any API to extract information 
			regarding a resource propreties.   
			<br>
			A resource can be subclassed into resource types.  An example of resouce types would be:<br> 
			<ul>
			  <li>web services</li>
			  <li>forms</li>
			  <li>form components</li>
			  <li>servlets</li>
			  <li>menus</li>  
			  <li>menu items</li>
			</ul>
      <br>
      Moreover, resource types can be subclassed into resource sub types.	 An example of sub types 
      for web service resources would be:<br>
      <ul>
			  <li>HTML</li>
			  <li>RMI</li>
			  <li>SOAP</li>
			  <li>XML</li>
			  <li>Sockets</li>  
			  <li>COM</li>
			</ul>
